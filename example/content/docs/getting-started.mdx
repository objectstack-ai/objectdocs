# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with ObjectDocs.

## Installation

First, create a new project directory and initialize it:

```bash
mkdir my-docs
cd my-docs
pnpm init
```

## Install ObjectDocs CLI

Add the ObjectDocs CLI as a dev dependency:

```bash
pnpm add -D @objectdocs/cli
```

## Configure Scripts

Add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "objectdocs dev",
    "build": "objectdocs build",
    "start": "objectdocs start"
  }
}
```

## Create Content Structure

Create the basic directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p content/docs
```

## Add Your First Page

Create `content/docs/index.mdx`:

```mdx
---
title: Welcome
description: My new docs site
---

# Hello World

Welcome to ObjectDocs!
```

Create `content/docs/meta.json`:

```json
{
  "pages": ["index"]
}
```

## Start Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777) to see your site.

The development server includes hot reload, so changes to your content will be reflected immediately.
</Callout>

## Build for Production

When you're ready to deploy, build your site:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will generate the production build in the `.next` directory (or `out` directory if configured for static export).
