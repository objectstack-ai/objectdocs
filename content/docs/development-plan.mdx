# ObjectDocs Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan and feature roadmap for ObjectDocs, a GitHub-native documentation engine optimized for Vercel deployment.

**Current Version**: v0.2.12 | **Last Updated**: 2026-02-09

## 🎯 Core Mission

ObjectDocs is purpose-built for **GitHub-based repository documentation** with seamless **Vercel deployment integration**. Our core objectives:

1. **Git-Native Workflow**: Leverage GitHub's collaboration features (PRs, reviews, issues) as the primary content management system
2. **Zero-Config Deployment**: Push to GitHub, auto-deploy to Vercel with optimal caching and CDN distribution
3. **Developer-First**: Treat documentation as code—version controlled, peer-reviewed, and CI/CD integrated

## 📊 Overall Progress Summary

| Package | Version | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `@objectdocs/cli` | v0.2.12 | ✅ Stable |
| `@objectdocs/site` | v0.2.12 | ✅ Stable |
| Root Workspace | v1.0.0 | ✅ Active |

| Phase | Status | Progress |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Phase 1: Core Platform & Deployment | ✅ Complete | ~95% |
| Phase 2: Developer Experience | 🟡 In Progress | ~35% |
| Phase 3: Advanced Features | ⬚ Planned | ~0% |

## 📅 Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Platform & Deployment (Q4 2025 – Q1 2026) ✅
