# Quick Start

ObjectDocs is a modern documentation engine based on Next.js 14 and Fumadocs, supporting the "Configuration as Code" philosophy. This guide will help you quickly set up a new documentation project.

## Prerequisites

Ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: 18.17 or higher
- **Package Manager**: pnpm is recommended (npm or yarn also work)

## 1. Create a New Project

We provide a CLI tool to quickly initialize your project. Run the following in your terminal:

<Steps>
### Initialize Directory Structure

In your project root, create the following file structure:

```bash
mkdir -p content/docs
```

### Install Dependencies

Install `@objectdocs/cli` as a development dependency:

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm add -D @objectdocs/cli
```

### Configure Scripts

Add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "objectdocs dev",
    "build": "objectdocs build",
    "start": "objectdocs start"
  }
}
```
</Steps>

## 2. Add Content

ObjectDocs uses file-system routing. All documentation is stored in the `content/docs` directory.

<Steps>
### Create Homepage

Create `content/docs/index.mdx`:

```mdx title="content/docs/index.mdx"
---
title: Welcome
description: Your new documentation site
---

# Hello World

Welcome to ObjectDocs! This is your homepage.
```

### Configure Sidebar

Create `content/docs/meta.json` to define page order:

```json title="content/docs/meta.json"
{
  "pages": ["index"]
}
```

### Configure Site Info

Create `content/docs.site.json` to configure site name and navigation:

```json title="content/docs.site.json"
{
  "branding": {
    "name": "My Docs"
  },
  "links": [
    {
      "text": "Home",
      "url": "/"
    }
  ]
}
```
</Steps>

## 3. Start Development Server

Run the following command to start the service:

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm dev
```

Now visit [http://localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777), and you should see your documentation site!
