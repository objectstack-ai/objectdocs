# What is ObjectDocs?

**ObjectDocs** is a modern, opinionated documentation site generator built on top of **Next.js 14** and **Fumadocs**.

It was created to solve a specific problem in the **ObjectStack** ecosystem: *How do we document complex, multi-product low-code platforms without drowning in frontend maintenance?*

Unlike general-purpose static site generators (SSGs), ObjectDocs treats documentation structure as **data**, not code.

## Core Philosophy

  <Card

    title="Metadata-Driven"

  >
    Control sidebars, navigation, and page ordering entirely through local `meta.json` files. No React knowledge required for content updates.

  >
    Directly embed JSON schemas in Markdown. Render live, interactive components powered by ObjectQL definitions.

## Why ObjectDocs?

### 1. Separation of Concerns
In traditional documentation sites, adding a new section often requires editing a global `sidebar.js` config or touching React components. In ObjectDocs, we strictly separate roles:

* **Technical Writers**: Write `.mdx` content and manage local `meta.json` for sorting.
* **Platform Architects**: Configure global `content/docs.site.json` (branding, nav links).
* **Frontend Developers**: Site engine is maintained as a separate package (`@objectdocs/site`), isolated in `content/.fumadocs`.

### 2. Clean Integration
ObjectDocs is designed to be added to any existing project:
* All documentation lives in `content/` directory
* Site engine is copied to `content/.fumadocs` (gitignored)
* Your project root stays clean and unpolluted
* No configuration files scattered across your repository

### 3. Interactive Components
Static text is not enough to showcase the capabilities of a low-code platform. ObjectDocs allows you to mount live component demos directly in your docs.
